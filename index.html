      <p>
        Welcome to the official website! My name is Pete, and I am the bass player of a warm and friendly,
        two piece ukulele ensemble "Dom & Pete". The other band member is my son Dominic, who plays
        ukulele and sings.
      </p>
      <p>
        We play mostly to support local charities, care homes and community centres and our music can
        be catered to suit the likes of your residents/audience. Our performance has been described as <em>wonderful and
          fabulous!</em>
      </p>

      <p>We can play vocal harmony sets from the Sixties, the Fifties, Charts, Vintage (old time) and Christmas. We even
        play a few punk rock songs! We can cater our song selections from your suggestions. We encourage your audience
        to join in with us as we play. We play in many care homes in the Morecambe and Lancaster area and the residents
        love us, come alive, sing along, and some even get up to dance as we play! We were recently invited to play at
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heyshamlibraryfriends"><strong>Heysham Library</strong></a> in support of their
        Platinum Jubilee celebrations when we performed a set with songs from the Fifties up to the present day.
      </p>

      <p>Our charges aren't high and we represent good value. Our performance lasts for about an hour; which would be around 20 songs. </p>

      <p>If you would like us to perform for your residents, <a href="#contact"><strong>please get in touch by e-mail or
            phone.</strong></a></p>
